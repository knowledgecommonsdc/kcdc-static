There's no time like the present to rediscover the lost art of letter writing.

### About this Event

Many of us have written letters before, but when was the last time? With all of the time we're spending online, now is a great time to rediscover the lost art of letter writing. During this workshop:

- Explore different examples of letters (funny, lighthearted, and loving)
- Discover helpful ways to share your feelings
- Discover how letters are more than just words
- Show how to write in pictures (doodling counts)
- Create a letter writing buddy list
- Discover how to make a letter unique and personal

Attendees will receive instructions on how to access the event via Zoom by May 28
