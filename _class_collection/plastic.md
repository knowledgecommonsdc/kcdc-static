Participate in a reading of the original comedic play, History of Plastic. The goal of the play is to educate and engage people on plastic pollution. The main character is "Plastic" personified. Plastic, who is a sociopath, tells his life story from when and why he was invented to how we use the material today. The play consists of 7 scenes with each featuring 3 to 4 characters. After each scene, you will have the opportunity to discuss what was presented.

Registered attendees will receive a Zoom link to access the class prior to May 12.

This play is a project from the nonprofit [GreenThinker DC](http://www.greenthinkerdc.org/)
whose mission is to get DC to ditch plastic pollution.
