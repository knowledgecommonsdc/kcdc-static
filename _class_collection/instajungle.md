### About this Event

Is quarantine forcing you to consider indoor plants? Is the springtime giving you green-thumb fever? Look no further. Whether you are a beginner, a dabbler or an enthusiast-- this class has something for you. Walk away with:

- Tips on where and how to start your indoor jungle.
- Pros and cons of the most common and least common houseplants
- Answers to your plant questions! We’ll cover everything from what the difference between “direct” and “indirect” light is to how to fully understand a plant’s needs.

The class will provide a mixture of resources and a look into Erica’s home where she is currently growing and propagating over 160 indoor plants with varying degrees of needs.

*Attendees will receive instructions to access the event on Zoom by May 2*
