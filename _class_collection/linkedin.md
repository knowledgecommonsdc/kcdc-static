### About this Event

LinkedIn is the largest social networking platform for professionals, with over 500 million users worldwide. While some people think of LinkedIn only as an online resume, it’s much more than that; LinkedIn is a place for you to showcase your talents and skills, connect with leaders in your industry, and strengthen your digital presence.

Now is the perfect time to ensure that you can use LinkedIn effectively to communicate why you’re a great candidate for new professional opportunities. According to human resources consulting firm RiseSmart, approximately ninety-five percent of job recruiters use LinkedIn to find candidates - but recruiters can't find you if you don’t have a strong profile. In this workshop, you’ll learn how to improve your LinkedIn presence by writing a dynamic headline, using your "About" section to describe your work clearly, and assembling a comprehensive "Experience" section.

Teacher Portia Obeng has eight years of experience in social media strategy and content management. She works to help people and organizations understand how they can use social media, not let social media use them. She encourages them to step away from continuous, mindless scrolling and figure out how to use social media to enhance their work, lives, and personal brands. Portia loves being Ghanaian, her family, spicy food, dancing, live music, and reading a good book (preferably on a beautiful beach in Ghana).
