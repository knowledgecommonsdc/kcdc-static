This is a class for beginning jugglers to move from not knowing how to juggle at all to juggling three balls - or at least being on the path to get there, with expert guidance to take you the rest of the way. Learning to juggle can create so many moments of delight for others and for yourself. It's a activity unto itself, and it's a great way to take a nourishing break from your desk job without shutting off your mind. In class, you'll learn the basics step by step, get feedback through regular check-ins with your teacher, and go at a pace that's right for you. All ages are welcome!

You'll need to supply your own juggling balls, but don't worry - you can make them at home! Here's how to use:

- Balloons and flour: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO8k2wOTmbQ
- Tennis balls and rice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdLB1WwKsfw
- Fabric and grain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zAT83kOcNs

Teacher Nathan Bynum has been juggling for more than three decades. He's taught hundreds of people to juggle through his work at Camp Winnarainbow Circus Camp, volunteering at a children's center in Mexico, after-school juggling clubs, and sharing the skill with people he's met on the road of life. Sharing the joy of juggling is a vocation and a side profession. He's been juggling at birthday parties and events in the DC area as The Jazzy Juggler since 2003. When he's not juggling, Nathan works as a social studies and science teacher, and edits and produces videos. Find out more about Nathan at www.nathanbynum.com.
