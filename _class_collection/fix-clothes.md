In the novel Brave New World, government propaganda pushes people to buy new stuff by claiming that “ending is better than mending.” But you’re too smart for those lies!

In this class, you’ll fight the forces of fast fashion by learning how to thread a needle, attach a button, darn a hole, and other basic hand sewing techniques to make your clothes last longer. Come save both your wallet and the environment, no sewing machine required.

The instructor will discuss and/or demonstrate various mending techniques, followed by Q&A. If there’s a particular item on which you want mending advice, bring it to class! Time permitting, we’ll discuss ideas for your next project.

### About the Instructor

Meg Hathaway is an environmental policy manager by day and hobby dabbler by night who also happens to be the daughter of a professional costume designer, which meant she grew up wearing incredibly badass Halloween costumes. Meg sadly never took to sewing as much as her mom, but picked up some quick and dirty mending tricks to repair her clothing and save stuff from the trash. By teaching mending basics, she hopes to empower others to reclaim the joy of fixing things and reduce their environmental impact.
